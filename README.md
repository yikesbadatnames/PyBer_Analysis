* <p> Here you can see that overall, the Urban cities had the most  rides, privers, and the most revenue per city by an extremely wide margin. While Urban cities were lower in Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver, this is made up for by having over 2x the amount of revenue as the 2nd highest catorgy. 

## Recomendation
* <p> I would recommend operations in rural environments, and allocating those drivers to Urban and Suburban areas. The revenue generated does not justify the operational costs of having those drivers in rural areas when there is an obvious demand elsewhere. </p>
* <p> Additionally, I would recommend shifting, or hiring more drivers to the suburban . Average Fare per Driver is well over over double in Suburban areas than in Urban areas. This might be indicitive of a high demand in the area, which we could exploit.
